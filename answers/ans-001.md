# Encryption at Rest

## Overview

All customer data stored in our systems is encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM encryption.

## Implementation Details

### Database Encryption
Our primary database (AWS RDS) uses AWS-managed encryption at the volume level using AES-256.
Encryption is enabled at provisioning time and cannot be disabled.

### Object Storage
Amazon S3 buckets use SSE-S3 (AES-256) by default. Customer-managed keys (SSE-KMS) are
available for Enterprise customers requiring key control.

### Backups
All automated backups are encrypted using the same key as the source data and are stored
in a separate AWS region.

### Key Management
Encryption keys are managed through AWS Key Management Service (KMS) with automatic annual
rotation. See `ans-017` for full key management details.
