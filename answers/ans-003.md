# Incident Response Plan

## Framework

Our Incident Response Plan (IRP) follows the NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 framework with five phases:

1. **Preparation** – CSIRT established, runbooks maintained, on-call rotation active
2. **Detection & Analysis** – SIEM alerts, anomaly detection, severity classification
3. **Containment** – Automated isolations and manual escalation procedures
4. **Eradication & Recovery** – Root cause analysis, patching, service restoration
5. **Post-Incident Review** – Written RCA within 5 business days

## Notification SLAs

| Event | Notification Timeline |
|-------|----------------------|
| Suspected breach – internal | Within 1 hour |
| Confirmed breach – customer | Within 72 hours |
| Regulatory notification (GDPR) | Within 72 hours per Art. 33 |

## Testing

The IRP is reviewed annually and tested via tabletop exercises. Results are documented
and used to improve runbooks and escalation procedures.
