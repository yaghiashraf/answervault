# Encryption in Transit

## Overview

All communications between clients and our services are encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.

## Technical Details

- **Protocol versions**: TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 are supported. TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are disabled.
- **Cipher suites**: Only AEAD cipher suites are permitted (e.g., AES-GCM, CHACHA20-POLY1305).
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)**: Enabled via ECDHE key exchange.
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security headers are set with `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`.
- **Internal traffic**: Service-to-service communication is also encrypted via mutual TLS (mTLS).

## Certificate Management

TLS certificates are issued by a trusted CA and renewed automatically 30 days before expiry.
Certificate transparency (CT) monitoring is in place to detect mis-issued certificates.
